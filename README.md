Multiple Linear Regression in Machine Learning
📌 Introduction

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between one dependent variable (target) and two or more independent variables (features). It extends Simple Linear Regression, which only uses one feature, by handling multiple predictors at the same time.

The model assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output:

𝑌=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋1+𝛽2𝑋2+...+𝛽𝑛𝑋𝑛+𝜖Y=β0	+β1X1+β2X2+...+βnXn+ϵ

Where:

𝑌
Y = dependent variable (target)

𝑋1,𝑋2,..,𝑋𝑛X1,X2,...,Xn	​= independent variables (features)
𝛽0β0 = intercept

𝛽1,𝛽2,...,𝛽𝑛β1,β2,...,βn = coefficients


ϵ = error term

🚀 Steps in Implementation

Import Libraries

numpy, pandas → for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn → for visualization

sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression → for regression model

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split → for splitting dataset

sklearn.metrics → for evaluation

Load Dataset

Load your dataset using pandas.read_csv() or other methods.

Preprocess Data

Handle missing values

Convert categorical variables (if any) using encoding techniques

Perform feature scaling if needed

Split Dataset

Divide into Training set and Testing set (e.g., 80%-20%)

Train Model

Fit the LinearRegression() model on the training dataset

Make Predictions

Use the trained model to predict target values for the test set

Evaluate Model

Metrics:

R² Score → goodness of fit

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

📊 Example Use Case

Predicting house prices based on area, number of bedrooms, and location

Estimating employee salary using experience, age, and education

Forecasting sales revenue from advertising spend across different channels

✅ Advantages

Simple to implement and interpret

Works well when relationship is approximately linear

Can handle multiple predictors simultaneously

❌ Limitations

Assumes linearity between features and target

Sensitive to multicollinearity among features

Performance decreases with noisy or irrelevant features


📌 Conclusion

Multiple Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning technique used for predictive analysis when more than one feature influences the target variable. It serves as the foundation for more advanced regression models.
